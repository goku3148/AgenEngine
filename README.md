# AgenEngine

AgenEngine is a framework for building multi‑agent AI workflows that integrate large language models (LLMs) and modular tool packages for flexible, real‑world applications.  
It is designed to let developers compose specialized agents, share context and tools, and orchestrate complex tasks end‑to‑end with maintainable structure.

## Overview

AgenEngine streamlines AI development by enabling multiple specialized agents to collaborate on complex workflows while keeping orchestration concerns separate from domain logic.  
Its modular approach supports incremental development, testing, and reuse, making it suitable for experimentation and production.

## Features

- Multi‑agent orchestration with explicit roles, goals, and structured handoffs.
- Model‑agnostic LLM integration to support different providers/backends.
- Modular tool packages (retrieval, execution, external APIs) as attachable capabilities.
- Memory patterns for short‑term context and durable knowledge across sessions.
- Project layout oriented for maintainability, configuration isolation, and CI.

## Architecture

- Agents: Encapsulate role, goal, skills/policies, and produce structured outputs.
- Tools: Standalone capability modules agents can invoke via well‑defined interfaces.
- Orchestrator: Coordinates tasks, dependencies, retries, and data flow.
- Memory: Abstractions for ephemeral context and persistent stores.
- Connectors: Configuration‑driven integrations for models, data sources, and services.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (recommended)  
- A virtual environment for isolated development  
- API keys for any external models or tools intended for use

## Installation

Clone the repository and install in editable mode for local development.

git clone https://github.com/goku3148/AgenEngine.git
cd AgenEngine

Create and activate a virtual environment (example)
python -m venv .venv

Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

Install project (editable mode during development)
pip install -e .

Optionally install dev/test extras if defined
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"


## Quickstart

Below is a minimal two‑agent workflow pattern to adapt to the codebase (pseudocode; adjust imports, class names, and APIs as implemented in this repository).

Pseudocode example — adjust to match AgenEngine's actual API
from agen_engine import Agent, Task, Workflow # replace with real package paths

researcher = Agent(
role="Senior Research Analyst",
goal="Find recent developments relevant to the prompt",
backstory="Expert at synthesizing reputable sources into concise briefs",
)

writer = Agent(
role="Technical Writer",
goal="Turn research into a clear report for the target audience",
backstory="Specializes in structured technical communication",
)

research = Task(
description="Summarize the top 3 developments in the past month on a topic",
agent=researcher,
outputs={"summary": "markdown", "sources": "list[str]"},
)

compose = Task(
description="Draft a 500-word report using the research outputs with citations",
agent=writer,
inputs={
"research_summary": research.outputs["summary"],
"sources": research.outputs["sources"],
},
)

flow = Workflow(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[research, compose], verbose=True)
final_report = flow.run()
print(final_report)


## Configuration

- Set model credentials and runtime settings using environment variables or a local config file excluded from version control.  
- Centralize tool configuration (API keys, endpoints, limits) so agents reference capabilities consistently.  
- Use per‑environment overrides for development, staging, and production.
